# archiso pin + supported range (BUILD-05).

# scripts/chroot.sh is staged as /root/customize_airootfs.sh and run by
# mkarchiso's `_make_customize_airootfs` hook — a mechanism mkarchiso ITSELF
# warns is deprecated ("Support for it will be removed in a future archiso
# version"). The whole keyring/paru/wheelhouse/liveuser-seed/microcode-stash/
# sanity-gate bootstrap rides on that hook. If a host archiso update drops it,
# the ISO still BUILDS but ships broken (no paru, no venv, no microcode, …).
#
# Supported range: archiso >= 75 (releng profile shape this pipeline targets)
# and the hook present (mkarchiso must still run customize_airootfs.sh).
# ARCHISO_PIN below is the exact known-good version this image builds against;
# bump it deliberately after re-confirming the hook survives. The mkiso.sh +
# validate.sh BUILD-05 guard re-checks the *installed* mkarchiso at build time,
# so a drift past this pin (or a manual host bump) fails LOUDLY, not silently.
